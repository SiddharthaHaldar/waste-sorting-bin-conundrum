# Waste Sorting Bin Conundrum

## Description

Proper waste sorting is critical for recycling. Given the large and varied amount of waste generated by the typical household, it can sometimes be difficult to know how to properly dispose of any given waste item.

Through this project, we aimed to create a web app to easily, efficiently and automatically identify and sort waste items by using neural networks to detect and classify waste items in images.

## Web app

Our app can be found at the following links. Try it out now!
